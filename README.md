Prototype to test out various features of glasses for a homecare scenario

* make a voice note
* setup a videocall with nurse/doctor
* recieve information about the client

This solution is not standalone unfortunately. It relaies on an agora webchat server as well as a firebase connection. As firebase is a little tricky to get onto the glasses, an android handset works as a server over BT.
